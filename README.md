# Card-Holder
Learning Project for a virtual card holder.

This is a virtual card holder app created using ASP.NET Core 5.0 (or as some may refer .NET 5.0) and Angular 8.

The purpose behind creating this app is to get hands-On experience on ASP.NET core and Angular by facilitating CRUD operations in the application.

The Card-Holder can be used to save the card details virtually to avoid the hassle of physically accessing the debit cards while doing any payment activities.
